>Welcome to my Rust teaching repository! ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä

I was just as new as you in rust, so let me be your companion and teach you head to toe..

Beginners requirement: ... p.p.phone maybe?

## Requirements

| Your requirement | Usage required |
|--------|--------|
| mobile | [termux](https://termux.dev/en/) |
| Windows | cmd[preinstalled] |
| Mac OS | You are own ur own üíÄ |
| Linux|  terminal[preinstalled]| 

## Installation
Since we are beginners lets just add better terminal for linux and MacOs, for windows try customizing your terminal with [this link](https://dev.to/ansonh/customize-beautify-your-windows-terminal-2022-edition-541l) and [ohmyposh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows) cauze its cool why not..

[CRT](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) a.k.a cool retro term is a amazing terminal that look like old cathode ray tube (crt) that can elevate you love in coding üòÖ. If you do not like crt, still you have [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

Lets start with installing rust <br>
<br>
- for Mobile(termux)
```yaml
pkg install rust
```
<br>

- for Linux

```yaml
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This commend helps in download for both macos and linux, in case for windows 
- for Windows
```bash
echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%
```
with this command one would find their architecture, now go to [rust installation](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html#standalone-installers) for standalone compiler (cause windows can only download new lang along-side rather then building it within).

## What's next‚ùì
<h4> After installing rust, you find a perfect project for yourself to fuel your thirst. </h3>

After choosing your project start to use rust with help of cargo or docker, why‚ùî you ask<br>
because it can **1)manage memory allocation and deallocation** rather then complicate it by allocating memory‚ò†Ô∏è ourself(it's not cool though) well, its not end with it.<br>
<br>
**2)Who wants to document if a package manager can do that**, as you read, it can do it all by itself. <br>
<br>
**3)Unlike Asian parents it won't broke for z or A^(-1)-tier code we wrote, rather it teach how to perfect it** don't worry child-labour is not real or thats what ccp says.<br>
<br>
## Programming¬ø
Nope. Cargo is pending....
